# Sample Microservice Application

Stan's Robot Shop is a sample microservice application you can use as a sandbox to test and learn containerised application orchestration and monitoring techniques. It is not intended to be a comprehensive reference example of how to write a microservices application, although you will better understand some of those concepts by playing with Stan's Robot Shop. To be clear, the error handling is patchy and there is not any security built into the application.

You can get more detailed information from my [blog post](https://www.instana.com/blog/stans-robot-shop-sample-microservice-application/) about this sample microservice application.

This sample microservice application has been built using these technologies:
- NodeJS ([Express](http://expressjs.com/))
- Java ([Spring Boot](https://spring.io/))
- Python ([Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org))
- Golang
- PHP (Apache)
- MongoDB
- Redis
- MySQL ([Maxmind](http://www.maxmind.com) data)
- RabbitMQ
- Nginx
- AngularJS (1.x)

The various services in the sample application already include all required Instana components installed and configured. The Instana components provide automatic instrumentation for complete end to end [tracing](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/tracing/), as well as complete visibility into time series metrics for all the technologies.

To see the application performance results in the Instana dashboard, you will first need an Instana account. Don't worry a [trial account](https://instana.com/trial?utm_source=github&utm_medium=robot_shop) is free.

## Project Architecture & Structure

This repository contains the application source, container builds, local runtime configuration, and CI automation:

1. **`.github/`** - GitHub workflows and automation
2. **`db/`** - Database schemas and initialization (`mongo`, `mysql`)
3. **`app/`** - Backend microservices (`cart`, `catalogue`, `dispatch`, `payment`, `ratings`, `shipping`, `user`)
4. **`web/`** - Storefront UI and Nginx reverse proxy

Kubernetes deployment configuration is maintained separately in the [Sumstore-GitOps](https://github.com/sumanthbcloud/Sumstore-GitOps) repository.

## Build from Source
To optionally build from source (you will need a newish version of Docker to do this) use Docker Compose. Optionally edit the `.env` file to specify an alternative image registry and version tag; see the official [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/) for more information.

To download the tracing module for Nginx, it needs a valid Instana agent key. Set this in the environment before starting the build.

```shell
$ export INSTANA_AGENT_KEY="<your agent key>"
```

Now build all the images.

```shell
$ docker-compose build
```

If you modified the `.env` file and changed the image registry, you need to push the images to that registry

```shell
$ docker-compose push
```

## Run Locally
You can run it locally for testing.

If you did not build from source, don't worry all the images are on Docker Hub. Just pull down those images first using:

```shell
$ docker-compose pull
```

Fire up Stan's Robot Shop with:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```

If you are running it locally on a Linux host you can also run the Instana [agent](https://docs.instana.io/quick_start/agent_setup/container/docker/) locally, unfortunately the agent is currently not supported on Mac.

There is also only limited support on ARM architectures at the moment.

## Kubernetes
The current Helm application configuration and Kubernetes infrastructure manifests are maintained in the [Sumstore-GitOps](https://github.com/sumanthbcloud/Sumstore-GitOps) repository.

## Accessing the Store
If you are running the store locally via *docker-compose up* then, the store front is available on localhost port 8080 [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

If you are running the store on Kubernetes via minikube then, find the IP address of Minikube and the Node Port of the web service.

```shell
$ minikube ip
$ kubectl get svc web
```

For Kubernetes access details, refer to the deployment configuration in [Sumstore-GitOps](https://github.com/sumanthbcloud/Sumstore-GitOps).

## Website Monitoring / End-User Monitoring

### Docker Compose

To enable Website Monioring / End-User Monitoring (EUM) see the official [documentation](https://docs.instana.io/website_monitoring/) for how to create a configuration. There is no need to inject the JavaScript fragment into the page, this will be handled automatically. Just make a note of the unique key and set the environment variable `INSTANA_EUM_KEY` and `INSTANA_EUM_REPORTING_URL` for the web image within `docker-compose.yaml`.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes monitoring configuration belongs with the current deployment manifests in [Sumstore-GitOps](https://github.com/sumanthbcloud/Sumstore-GitOps).

## Prometheus

The cart and payment services both have Prometheus metric endpoints. These are accessible on `/metrics`. The cart service provides:

* Counter of the number of items added to the cart

The payment services provides:

* Counter of the number of items perchased
* Histogram of the total number of items in each cart
* Histogram of the total value of each cart

To test the metrics use:

```shell
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/cart/metrics
$ curl http://<host>:8080/api/payment/metrics
```



## Automated E2E Smoke Test

An automated end-to-end smoke test validates the complete customer purchase lifecycle against the deployed storefront and microservices (catalogue lookup, user registration, cart operations, shipping calculation, rating submission, and payment/order processing):

```shell
BASE_URL=http://<sum-store-endpoint> ./scripts/e2e-smoke-test.sh
```
